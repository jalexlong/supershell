    [Welcome to SuperShell]

    For years, you have interacted with computers through a veil.

    You clicked on icons drawn by others. You navigated paths paved by engineers
    who didn't trust you. You were a guest in your own house, relying on the
    mouse — a device that limits your speed to the physical motion of your wrist.

    That ends now.

    You have stripped away the Graphical User Interface. What remains is the Shell.

    To the uninitiated, this black screen looks archaic. It looks empty.
    But to the master, this silence is potential. The GUI limits you to what
    has been programmed *for* you. The Shell empowers you to execute what
    you *will*.

    Here, you do not point. You do not click. You speak, and the machine obeys.

    Welcome to the Terminal.
  debriefing: |
    [PROFICIENCY LOGGED]

    You have taken your first steps without a visual guide.
    The silence of the terminal is no longer a void; it is a waiting room.

    You are ready to begin building.
  checkpoints:
    - id: "t0_ping"
      name: "The Sonar"
      instruction: |
        In the GUI, you "look" at a window to see your files.
        Here, the screen is dark. You must actively ask the system to describe itself.

        Cast your senses out. List the contents of this space.
      objective: "Type: ls"
      success: "Vision returned. The system has revealed its contents."
      conditions:
        - type: CommandMatches
          pattern: "^ls.*"

    - id: "t0_triangulate"
      name: "True North"
      instruction: |
        Scanning tells you *what* is nearby, but not *where* you are.

        You must understand the Map. Linux is an "Upside-Down Tree."
        At the very top is the ROOT, represented by a single slash: /
        Every file, folder, and program grows downward from that single point.

        You are currently on a branch called "home".
        Ask the system to print your absolute coordinates (Working Directory).
      objective: "Type: pwd"
      success: "Coordinates locked. You are grounded."
      conditions:
        - type: CommandMatches
          pattern: "^pwd$"

    - id: "t0_root_logic"
      name: "The Origin"
      instruction: |
        Look at the output of your last command. It likely reads something like:
        /home/username

        This is a "path." It traces the route from the root (/) through the
        branches (home) to you (username).

        To truly understand the scale of the system, let us look at the source.
        List the contents of the root directory.
      objective: "Type: ls /"
      success: "The Foundation revealed. This is the trunk of the tree."
      conditions:
        - type: CommandMatches
          pattern: "^ls\\s+/"

    - id: "t0_look"
      name: "Manifestation"
      instruction: |
        "Now that we can see the root directory "
      objective: "Type: mkdir workspace"
      success: "It is done. The structure now exists because you commanded it."
      conditions:
        - type: CommandMatches
          pattern: "^mkdir.*workspace"
        - type: FileExists
          path: "workspace"

    - id: "t0_construct"
      name: "Manifestation"
      instruction: |
        Now that you know the shape of the world, we can alter it.
        There is no "Right Click -> New Folder" here.
        If you want structure, you must speak it into existence.

        Command the system to make a directory named 'workspace'.
      objective: "Type: mkdir workspace"
      success: "It is done. The structure now exists because you commanded it."
      conditions:
        - type: CommandMatches
          pattern: "^mkdir.*workspace"
        - type: FileExists
          path: "workspace"

    - id: "t0_translation"
      name: "Focus Shift"
      instruction: |
        The directory exists, but you are still standing outside of it.
        Movement in the Shell is not physical; it is a shift in focus.

        We will use a "Relative Path." Since 'workspace' is right next to us,
        we do not need the full address (starting with /). We just say the name.

        Change your context into the 'workspace'.
      objective: "Type: cd workspace"
      success: "Focus shifted. You are now inside the construct."
      conditions:
        - type: CommandMatches
          pattern: "^cd.*workspace"

    - id: "t0_verify"
      name: "Trusting Silence"
      instruction: |
        The prompt has changed, but the screen is empty.
        In the GUI, an empty folder is a white box. Here, it is simply silence.

        Verify the room is empty. If the system says nothing, it means there is nothing.
      objective: "Type: ls"
      success: "Silence confirmed. The space is clean."
      conditions:
        - type: CommandMatches
          pattern: "^ls.*"

    - id: "t0_predict"
      name: "The Harmony"
      instruction: |
        We must return to the previous level.
        We could type the absolute path, but there is a shortcut.

        In the Linux Tree, every directory contains a hidden link called ".." (Dot Dot).
        This link points to the "Parent" branch—the one directly above you.

        Type 'cd ..' to climb up one level.
        [PRO TIP]: Use the [TAB] key in the future to autocomplete names.
      objective: "Type: cd .."
      success: "Returned to origin. Path integration complete."
      conditions:
        - type: CommandMatches
          pattern: "^cd \\.\\."
